# Crash Courses

This repository aims to help beginners gain a basic understanding in programming and coding

## Other Guides

- These are some other guides which may be useful in your coding journey

<summary>Adding Kernels to IPYNB</summary>

- By default, Jupyter Notebook only runs Python codes
- In order to run a particular language on Jupyter Notebook, you must first install the necessary interpreter (Java uses jshell so I shall consider it as an interpreter, even though it is considered a compiled language)

<summary>Using Git</summary>

- Git is a software used for version tracking, as well as collaboration among programmers during software development.

## Sorting Algorithms
- There are implementations of sorting algorithms in this repository
- The list of sorting algorithms available are listed below
- For comparison based sorting, the best case time complexity will be O(N log N)
- For non-comparison based sorting (i.e radix sort) will have a runtime complexity of O(N)
