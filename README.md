# Crash Courses

The repository houses codes which can help introduce programming to others.

## Other Guides

- These are some other guides which may be useful in your coding journey

<summary>Using Git</summary>

### What is it?
- Git is a software used for version tracking, as well as collaboration among programmers during software development.

<summary>Adding Kernels to IPYNB</summary>

### What is it?
- By default, Jupyter Notebook only runs Python codes
- In order to run a particular language on Jupyter Notebook, you must first install the necessary interpreter (Java uses jshell so I shall consider it as an interpreter, even though it is considered a compiled language)
